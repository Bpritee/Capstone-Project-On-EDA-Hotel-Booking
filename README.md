Project Overview:

This project aims to conduct a thorough analysis of a hotel booking dataset using Python's Pandas library and Tableau. The dataset encompasses bookings for both a city hotel and a resort hotel, comprising information such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, and special requests. The objective is to develop insightful visualizations and employ statistical techniques, if necessary, to validate assumptions and derive meaningful insights. Through this analysis, the goal is to understand patterns, identify trends, and explore relationships within the data.
## Efficient Approach to the Problem Statement

Understand the Dataset: Familiarize yourself with the dataset structure, data types, and key attributes.

Data Cleaning: Address inconsistencies, rectify discrepancies, eliminate duplicates, and standardize formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use EDA to discover patterns, relationships, and initial insights.

Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate key findings and trends.

Statistical Analysis: Employ statistical techniques to validate assumptions and derive meaningful insights.

Conclusion and Reporting: Summarize key insights and present them to stakeholders.
## Data Exploration Techniques and Logic

 - Data Profiling: Use Pandas to get an overview of the data, including descriptive statistics.
 - Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual variables to understand their distribution and central tendencies.
 - Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.
- Multivariate Analysis: Examine complex relationships involving more than two variables.


## Project Usefulness to Stakeholders

- Operational Efficiency: Improve operational processes based on insights from booking patterns and guest preferences.
- Revenue Management: Optimize pricing and revenue strategies by understanding seasonal variations and booking trends.
- Guest Experience: Enhance guest satisfaction by catering to identified preferences and special requests.
